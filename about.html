    <p>This project is an "Items Recorder" application that allows users to input and track items.
    It provides a form where users can enter the item details, such as name, description, price, and image URL,
    and dynamically generates card items to display the entered information.
    Users can also remove items from the list by clicking on the close button. </p>
    All currency are by default Canadian dollars in this project.
